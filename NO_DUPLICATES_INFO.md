# ✅ No Duplicate Rewards - 1GB Only for New Users

## 🎯 Policy Implemented

### New User Policy:
✅ **First-time users get 1GB FREE data**
✅ **Existing users CANNOT claim 1GB again**
✅ **Phone numbers are checked before rewards are given**
✅ **Database prevents duplicate entries**

---

## 🔒 How It Works

### When User Submits Phone:

1. **System Checks Database**
   - Searches for phone number
   - If NOT found: New user → Gets 1GB ✅
   - If FOUND: Existing user → No new 1GB ❌

2. **New User Flow:**
   - Phone number entered
   - System checks database
   - Phone NOT found → NEW USER
   - Creates account with 1GB awarded
   - Shows success: "🎉 You just got 1GB FREE DATA!"

3. **Existing User Flow:**
   - Phone number entered
   - System checks database
   - Phone FOUND → ALREADY REGISTERED
   - Account exists with 1GB already claimed
   - Shows: "✅ You're already registered! You claimed your 1GB already."
   - Shows their referral progress

## 📊 Data Protection

### Database Rules:
✅ **Phone numbers are UNIQUE** (database constraint)
✅ **Cannot create duplicate phone entries**
✅ **System rejects duplicate submissions automatically**

### Reward Tracking:
- `data_awarded` field stores reward amount
- New users start with: `data_awarded = 1` (1GB)
- Bonus users get: `data_awarded = 5` (5GB total)
- Existing users keep their original award

## 🎁 Reward System

### First-Time Users:
✅ **1GB free data** (automatically awarded)
✅ **Referral code generated**
✅ **Can refer friends for bonus**

### Existing Users:
❌ **No additional 1GB** (already claimed)
✅ **Can refer friends for 4GB bonus**
✅ **View their referral progress**

### Bonus System:
🎯 **Get 4GB more by referring 5 friends**
- User gets 1GB on signup
- User gets additional 4GB after 5 referrals
- Total possible: 5GB (1GB + 4GB bonus)

## 🚫 Duplicate Prevention

### Technical Safeguards:

1. **Database Constraint:**
   ```sql
   phone_number TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
   ```
   - Prevents duplicate phone numbers
   - Database automatically rejects duplicates

2. **Application Check:**
   - Backend checks before insertion
   - Returns early if phone exists
   - Shows appropriate message

3. **User Interface:**
   - Shows different messages for new vs existing users
   - New users see "🎉 Got 1GB!"
   - Existing users see "Already registered"
