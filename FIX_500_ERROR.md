# âœ… Fixed 500 Error!

## ðŸ”§ What Was Wrong:
The admin panel was trying to export users with the `exported_at` column, but that column doesn't exist in the database yet.

## âœ… What I Fixed:
1. Made the export-new endpoint work without the `exported_at` column
2. Added fallback logic to fetch all users if column doesn't exist
3. All export buttons should work now!

---

## ðŸš€ Try Again Now:

### Option 1: Just Use It (Works Now!)
The exports now work WITHOUT the `exported_at` column.
- **Export New Users** - Exports all users (since tracking not set up yet)
- **Export 4GB** - Exports users with 5+ referrals âœ…
- **All Referrers** - Exports anyone who made referrals âœ…
- **Export ALL** - Complete list âœ…

### Option 2: Set Up Proper Tracking
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor for full export tracking:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exported_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_exported ON users(exported_at);
```

## âœ… Admin Panel Should Work Now!

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:5173/admin
2. **Try any export button**
3. **Should work without errors!**

**The 500 error is fixed!** ðŸŽ‰
